# nfsw-server

The code is currently a living mess, I call it Richard myself. The db<->server<->client talk is disasterously bad and will basically make your PC run out of memory after about an hour of active usage. 

This has some useful quick look-up information in it, like the BaseCarId and the PhyicsProfileHash definitions or the internal car hash instances for most cars.

I will eventually rewrite this, peace be with you, prosperer!
